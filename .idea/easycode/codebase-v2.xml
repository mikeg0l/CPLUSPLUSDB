This suggests the Parser class has a method to parse a CREATE TABLE SQL statement. \\n\\n- parseCreateTable() is currently empty and just returns an empty string. This is likely a placeholder or work in progress implementation.\\n\\n- There are no other methods defined in this file. Other parsing methods like parseSelect(), parseInsert(), etc would likely be defined either here or in the parser.h header.\\n\\nSo in summary:\\n\\n- Contains a Parser class definition \\n- Parser has a method to parse CREATE TABLE statements\\n- Likely parses other SQL statements as well which are not yet implemented\\n- Acts as an interface to parse SQL and extract information from statements\\n\\nThe key function listed in this file is Parser::parseCreateTable() which is intended to parse a CREATE TABLE SQL statement. Other parsing functionality is suggested but not yet implemented in this file.\&quot;,\&quot;/table/table.cpp\&quot;:\&quot;This file defines the Table class that represents a database table.\\n\\nThe key functions are:\\n\\n- Table constructor - Initializes the table with a name, column names and types.\\n\\n- insert - Adds a new row of data to the table. \\n\\n- display - Prints out the table contents.\\n\\n- addColumn - Adds a new column to the table.\\n\\n- update - Updates an existing row based on conditions. \\n\\n- convertAndAssignValue - Helper to convert a value to the correct data type for a column.\\n\\n- save - Saves the table data to a file.\\n\\n- createRelation - Not implemented, likely for defining relationships to other tables.\\n\\n- deleteRow - Not implemented, for deleting a row. \\n\\n- deleteTable - Not implemented, for deleting the entire table.\\n\\n- getPrimaryKey - Gets the primary key column name. \\n\\n- getName - Gets the table name.\\n\\n- getColumnOrder - Gets the ordered list of column names.\\n\\nSo in summary, it defines the core functionality for representing a database table in memory, inserting/updating data, printing the contents, and saving/loading from a file.\&quot;,\&quot;/utils/mapper.h\&quot;:\&quot;This file contains utilities for mapping between data types in C++.\\n\\nThe key things it does:\\n\\n1. Defines a Mapper struct with a static function mapColumnType() that maps a string column type to a DataType enum. This is used to convert column types read from the database to the internal DataType representation.\\n\\n2. Defines visitable structs that can operate on variants holding different data types:\\n\\n  - DataTypeToStringValue converts values to strings for output/display\\n  - DataTypeToStringValueSave converts values to strings with quotes for saving to database \\n  - DataTypeToTypeString converts values to their type name as a string\\n\\n3. These visitable structs are used with std::visit to uniformly operate on variants holding different data types. This avoids needing to check the held type and have separate code paths.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- Mapper::mapColumnType() - Maps string column type to internal DataType \\n- DataTypeToStringValue::operator() - Converts variant value to string for output\\n- DataTypeToStringValueSave::operator() - Converts variant value to string for saving  \\n- DataTypeToTypeString::operator() - Converts variant value to type name string\\n\\nSo in summary, it provides utilities for mapping between external database types and internal representations, and for uniformly operating on variants holding different data types.\&quot;,\&quot;/utils/printer.cpp\&quot;:\&quot;This file contains a Printer class that provides functions for printing formatted output.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- printHorizontalLine(unsigned long long size) - Prints a horizontal line of the given size by repeating the character \\u0027-\\u0027 that many times. It uses the fmt library for formatted printing.\\n\\nThis file:\\n\\n- Defines a Printer class for printing formatted output\\n- Includes the fmt library for formatted printing \\n- Contains a printHorizontalLine() method that prints a horizontal line of a given length by repeating characters\\n- Uses fmt for formatted printing of the line and newline character\\n\\nSo in summary, it provides a Printer utility class with a function to print a horizontal line separator of adjustable length, using the fmt library for formatted output. This could be used to cleanly print separators or dividers in console/terminal output.\&quot;,\&quot;/table/table.h\&quot;:\&quot;This file defines a Table class that represents a database table.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- Table constructor - Initializes a table with a name, column names and types.\\n\\n- display() - Prints out the contents of the table. \\n\\n- insert() - Inserts a new row into the table.\\n\\n- addColumn() - Adds a new column to the table. \\n\\n- convertAndAssignValue() - Converts a string value to the appropriate data type and assigns it to a row.\\n\\n- createRelation() - Likely used to define relationships between tables.\\n\\n- update() - Updates an existing row matching conditions. \\n\\n- deleteRow() - Deletes a row from the table.\\n\\n- save() - Saves the table contents to a file.\\n\\n- getName(), getPrimaryKey(), getColumnOrder() - Getter functions to access table metadata.\\n\\nIt also defines enum types for SQL commands and clauses that will likely be used to parse SQL queries for the tables. Overall it provides the core functionality for representing and manipulating database tables in memory.\&quot;,\&quot;/database/database.cpp\&quot;:\&quot;This file defines a Database class that manages a collection of tables.\\n\\nThe key functions are:\\n\\n- getTable(name) - Returns a pointer to the Table object with the given name. Returns null if not found.\\n\\n- addTable(table) - Adds a new Table object to the database. \\n\\n- loadTable(filePath) - Loads a table from a data file at the given file path. Parses the file and inserts the data into a new Table object which is then added to the database.\\n\\n- listTables() - Prints out the name of each table in the database.\\n\\n- deleteTable(name) - Removes the table with the given name from the database.\\n\\nThe Database class stores the tables in a std::vector\\u003cTable\\u003e member variable called tables. It provides functions to retrieve, add, load, list and delete tables from this collection. The loadTable function handles parsing a data file into a Table object.\\n\\nSo in summary, it defines a class that manages an in-memory collection of Table objects, allowing tables to be loaded from files, retrieved, added, listed and deleted from the database.\&quot;,\&quot;/database/database.h\&quot;:\&quot;This database.h file defines a Database class that represents an in-memory database.\\n\\nThe key functions it provides are:\\n\\n- getTable(const std::string\\u0026 name) - Returns a pointer to the Table object with the given name. This allows accessing a table by name.\\n\\n- addTable(const Table\\u0026 table) - Adds a new Table object to the database. \\n\\n- loadTable(const std::string \\u0026filePath) - Loads a table from a file and adds it to the database.\\n\\n- listTables() - Prints out the names of all tables in the database. \\n\\n- deleteTable(const std::string\\u0026 name) - Removes the table with the given name from the database.\\n\\nSo in summary, it provides basic database functionality like storing and retrieving tables by name, loading tables from files, listing tables, and deleting tables. The tables themselves are represented by the Table class defined elsewhere.\&quot;,\&quot;/table/datatype.h\&quot;:\&quot;This file defines a data type called DataType that allows a variable to hold values of different types using std::variant.\\n\\nKey things:\\n\\n- std::variant allows a variable to hold one of a set of predefined types. Here it can hold a std::string, int, float, or bool.\\n\\n- DataType is defined as an alias for std::variant\\u003cstd::string, int, float, bool\\u003e. This makes it easier to use than writing out the full std::variant type name.\\n\\n- No functions are defined, this is just a type definition header file. It allows other code to include this header and use DataType as a variable that can hold one of those base types.\\n\\n- Some key things std::variant provides are get\\u003cT\\u003e() to retrieve the value as a specific type if known, valueless_by_exception to throw if the wrong type is accessed, and visitation to apply a function to the contained value.\\n\\nSo in summary, this file defines a DataType that can hold different base types using std::variant, allowing variables of this type to dynamically take on one of those predefined types. It provides a common way for other code to use this polymorphic data type.\&quot;,\&quot;/utils/parser.h\&quot;:\&quot;This file declares a Parser class that contains functions for parsing SQL statements.\\n\\nKey things:\\n\\n- It\\u0027s a header file included with #pragma once to avoid multiple inclusion issues.\\n\\n- It includes the string header as it will likely be parsing and working with strings. \\n\\n- It declares a Parser class.\\n\\n- The only function declared is parseCreateTable, which is static. This suggests the Parser class contains only static utility functions rather than instance methods.\\n\\n- parseCreateTable takes no parameters and returns a string. This implies it will parse a CREATE TABLE statement from somewhere and return the parsed result as a string.\\n\\nSo in summary:\\n\\n- It declares a Parser utility class with static functions.\\n- The only function declared is parseCreateTable() which parses a CREATE TABLE statement and returns the result as a string.\\n- It provides an interface for parsing SQL statements like CREATE TABLE into a usable format like strings.\&quot;,\&quot;/utils/mapper.cpp\&quot;:\&quot;This file contains a mapper class that is used to map database column types to native data types.\\n\\nThe key functions are:\\n\\n- mapColumnType() - Takes in a column type as a string and returns the corresponding native data type. It maps:\\n  - \\\&quot;string\\\&quot;/\\\&quot;STRING\\\&quot; to std::string\\n  - \\\&quot;int\\\&quot;/\\\&quot;INT\\\&quot; to int\\n  - \\\&quot;float\\\&quot;/\\\&quot;FLOAT\\\&quot; to float \\n  - \\\&quot;bool\\\&quot;/\\\&quot;BOOL\\\&quot; to bool\\n\\nThis function allows retrieving column types from a database and mapping them to native types that can be used in the programming language, without having to write explicit type conversion code each time.\\n\\nThe mapper class abstracts away the mapping between database column types and programming language data types, making it easier to retrieve and use data from the database in a typesafe way within the code.\&quot;,\&quot;/table/tablerow.h\&quot;:\&quot;This file defines a TableRow struct that represents a row in a table.\\n\\nKey things:\\n\\n- It defines a TableRow struct that will represent a single row.\\n\\n- The TableRow contains an unordered_map called columns. This maps column names (strings) to DataType values. DataType is likely defined elsewhere but represents the possible types a column can have (int, string, etc).\\n\\n- This allows a TableRow to store a variable number of columns, with each column mapped by name to its value which can be of different data types.\\n\\n- There are no functions defined, just the struct. This is likely meant to be used elsewhere to represent rows in a table/database context.\\n\\n- Key \\\&quot;functions\\\&quot; would be things like adding/removing columns via the columns map, accessing a column by name, iterating over columns, etc. But those functions are not defined here, just the data structure.\\n\\nSo in summary, it defines a struct that can represent a single row of data in a table, with columns mapped by name to different data types. No functions defined, just the data structure that will likely be used elsewhere.\&quot;}&quot;,&quot;C:/Users/golasmi1/workspace/CPLUSPLUSDB&quot;:&quot;{\&quot;/cmake-build-debug/CMakeFiles/3.27.8/CompilerIdCXX/CMakeCXXCompilerId.cpp\&quot;:\&quot;This file is used to detect information about the compiler and build environment.\\n\\nThe key things it does:\\n\\n- Defines macros to identify the compiler (COMPILER_ID) and extract the major/minor/patch version numbers.

This allows tools to locate where the build is taking place and the original source code.\\n\\n- backtraceGraph - Empty objects for commands, files, and nodes. This provides a place to store debugging information about the CMake execution backtrace/graph, but is empty here since debugging is not enabled. \\n\\n- installers - Empty array. This would contain information about custom install rules and targets if any were defined in the CMake code.\\n\\nSo in summary, its main functions are:\\n\\n- Provide location of build and source directories \\n- Reserve space for capturing CMake execution backtrace/graph (if debugging enabled)\\n- Reserve space for describing custom install rules (if defined)\\n\\nIt acts as a central metadata file in the build directory that tools can read to understand the context and configuration of the CMake build being performed.\&quot;,\&quot;/table/table.cpp\&quot;:\&quot;This file defines the Table class that represents a database table.\\n\\nThe key functions are:\\n\\n- Table constructor - Initializes the table name, columns, column types, etc.\\n\\n- insert() - Inserts a new row into the table.\\n\\n- display() - Prints out the contents of the table. \\n\\n- addColumn() - Adds a new column to the table.\\n\\n- update() - Updates an existing row based on conditions. \\n\\n- convertAndAssignValue() - Helper function to convert values to the correct data type.\\n\\n- save() - Saves the table to a file.\\n\\n- createRelation() - Placeholder for creating relationships between tables. \\n\\n- deleteRow() - Placeholder for deleting a row.\\n\\n- deleteTable() - Placeholder for deleting the entire table.\\n\\n- getPrimaryKey() - Gets the primary key of the table.\\n\\n- getName() - Gets the name of the table. \\n\\n- getColumns() - Gets the column definitions as a map.\\n\\nSo in summary, it defines the core functionality for representing and manipulating a database table in memory and saving/loading it to file.\&quot;,\&quot;/cmake-build-debug/_deps/fmt-src/doc/conf.py\&quot;:\&quot;This file is the configuration file for building the documentation for the fmt library using Sphinx.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- Sets up Sphinx extensions like breathe for linking to Doxygen documentation.\\n\\n- Configures output formats like HTML, LaTeX, manual pages, etc. \\n\\n- Sets metadata like project name, copyright, author, etc. \\n\\n- Configures paths for templates, static files, and Doxygen output.\\n\\n- Configures Sphinx themes and templates for HTML output. \\n\\n- Groups documents into LaTeX/manual page/texinfo files for non-HTML output formats.\\n\\n- Runs Doxygen to generate API docs from headers on ReadTheDocs.\\n\\nIn summary, it configures Sphinx to:\\n\\n- Parse and render the documentation source files \\n- Link to generated API docs\\n- Produce different output formats like HTML, PDF, etc.\\n- Set metadata and templates for the build\\n\\nSo it controls how the documentation is built and formatted for different targets.\&quot;,\&quot;/utils/mapper.h\&quot;:\&quot;This file contains mapping utilities for converting between database column types and C++ types.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- mapColumnType: Maps a string representation of a database column type (e.g. \\\&quot;varchar\\\&quot;) to a DataType enum value.\\n\\n- DataTypeToStringValue: A visitor that converts a DataType variant to a string representation of its value. Used to convert database values to strings. \\n\\n- DataTypeToStringType: A visitor that converts a DataType variant to a string representation of its type (e.g. \\\&quot;STRING\\\&quot;). Used to get the type name as a string.\\n\\nThe main purpose of this file is to provide utilities for:\\n\\n1. Mapping database column types to C++ types \\n2. Converting between C++ types and string representations for values and types\\n\\nThis allows interacting with database values as C++ variants while still being able to convert them to strings for storage, display, etc. The visitors leverage std::visit to operate on the variant types.\&quot;,\&quot;/utils/printer.cpp\&quot;:\&quot;This file contains a Printer class that provides functions for printing formatted output.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- printHorizontalLine(unsigned long long size) - Prints a horizontal line of the given size by repeating the character \\u0027-\\u0027 that many times.

Commonly it will have sections for things like problem description, proposed solution, testing done, etc. This helps pull requests be clear and consistent.\\n\\n- Serves as a reminder to discuss proposed changes with maintainers before submitting the pull request. Early discussion can avoid wasted effort on changes that may not be accepted. \\n\\nSo in summary, it provides guidance for contributors, obtains agreement to licensing terms, and structures pull request content - all helping the project review and accept contributions in a clear and compliant way. The template helps streamline the contribution process.\&quot;,\&quot;/cmake-build-debug/.cmake/api/v1/reply/toolchains-v1-b15c73871462cb939849.json\&quot;:\&quot;This file contains toolchain information returned by CMake in response to a request for toolchains.\\n\\nKey things:\\n\\n- It is a JSON file that defines the \\\&quot;toolchains\\\&quot; for a particular CMake build.\\n\\n- The \\\&quot;toolchains\\\&quot; array contains entries for each supported toolchain (compiler, linker etc). \\n\\n- Each toolchain entry specifies:\\n\\n  - The compiler/tool ID and version\\n\\n  - Implicit include paths, link paths and libraries\\n\\n  - The path to the compiler/tool executable\\n\\n  - The language it supports \\n\\n  - File extensions of source files it can handle\\n\\n- This provides CMake with all the information it needs to determine which toolchain to use for a given source file and how to invoke the compiler/linker.\\n\\n- The main functions of this file are:\\n\\n  - Define the available toolchains for a CMake build\\n\\n  - Provide paths and settings for each toolchain compiler/tool\\n\\n  - Allow CMake to map source files to the correct toolchain based on file extension\\n\\nSo in summary, it defines and describes the available toolchains/compilers that CMake can use for a particular build.\&quot;,\&quot;/cmake-build-debug/_deps/fmt-build/CMakeFiles/fmt.dir/compiler_depend.ts\&quot;:\&quot;This file is a timestamp file generated by CMake for managing compiler-generated dependencies for the fmt library.\\n\\nSome key things about this file:\\n\\n- It is located in the _deps/fmt-build/CMakeFiles/fmt.dir directory, which indicates it is related to building the fmt target.\\n\\n- The filename compiler_depend.ts indicates it tracks compiler-generated dependencies. The .ts extension stands for \\\&quot;timestamp\\\&quot;.\\n\\n- CMake uses timestamp files like this to track when source files are modified, so it knows when it needs to re-run the compiler to rebuild dependent targets.\\n\\n- The main function of this file is to store the last modified time of source files that the fmt target depends on. This allows CMake to determine if dependencies are out of date.\\n\\n- When any source files are modified, this file will be updated to reflect the new timestamps. \\n\\n- CMake checks this file on subsequent builds to see if any dependencies timestamps have changed since the last build. If so, it will recompile targets as needed.\\n\\n- This helps CMake avoid unnecessary recompiles when dependencies haven\\u0027t actually changed.\\n\\nSo in summary, the key function is to track timestamps of dependent source files to help CMake efficiently manage recompiling targets only when dependencies are truly out of date.\&quot;,\&quot;/cmake-build-debug/_deps/fmt-src/include/fmt/printf.h\&quot;:\&quot;This file defines functionality for formatted printing (printf-style formatting) in the fmt library.\\n\\nKey things it does:\\n\\n- Defines basic_printf_context and related types for handling printf arguments and formatting context.\\n\\n- Defines printf_formatter class template to handle formatting different argument types. \\n\\n- Defines parsing functions like parse_header() to parse format strings.\\n\\n- Defines printf_arg_formatter class to format arguments according to printf specs. \\n\\n- Defines vprintf() function to format and print with a printf-style format string and arguments.\\n\\nKey functions:\\n\\n- make_printf_args() -

This is common for libraries to link to their hosted documentation rather than rebuild it from source for each project.\\n\\n- Read the Docs uses reStructuredText (.rst) files to define the documentation structure and content. This file simply contains a redirect message with a link to the main fmt docs site. \\n\\n- No functions are defined in this file, as it is just providing a redirect. The key \\\&quot;function\\\&quot; is to redirect users viewing the documentation build for the project dependency to the canonical hosted documentation instead of building docs locally.\\n\\nSo in summary, this index.rst file is a configuration file used by Read the Docs to redirect users to the main fmt documentation website rather than attempting to build docs for the fmt dependency from the source included in this project.
